In this way, each segment corresponds to customer groups of similar size and similar characteristics.\n","\n","Clarifying Customer Behaviors:\n","\n","The five slices help make customer behavior more specific. For example, the \"Highest Score\" bracket might represent the most valuable customers, while the \"Lowest Score\" bracket might represent less active or valuable customers.\n","\n","Manageability:\n","\n","Five slices make the analysis more manageable. Using too many segments can make it difficult to develop and implement strategies for segments.\n","\n","General Suitability for Use:\n","\n","Five slices is a commonly used number in general and is preferred by many businesses. Therefore, it is a standard frequently encountered in the literature and practice.\n","\n","However, the choice of the number of slices depends entirely on the purpose of the analysis, the characteristics of the data set and business strategies. In different situations, three, four, six or more slices may be used.
